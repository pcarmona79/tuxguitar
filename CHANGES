/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/templates/template-default.tg

key names instead of number of sharps / flats for german language file in
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_de.properties

changed keys for note duration change near the cursor arrows.
increase : ','  decrease: '-'
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/dist/tuxguitar-shortcuts.xml
i guess increase makes the notes smaller. 

01/07/2021
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_de.properties
/home/ptero/tuxguitar/TuxGuitar/share/lang/messages_en.properties
    -> added :
tools.transpose.apply-to-selection


yin pitch detection:
TuxGuitar-tuner/src/org/herac/tuxguitar/app/tools/custom/tuner/TGTuner.java
...opens dataline with settings and reads audio
doFFT does actual processing
computeFFT seems unused
TGTuner owns FFT, which has the method computeFFT
when dataline is opened, fft is initialized before
->so we should create a yin class, and instantiate with settings ...?!?
TGTuner owns settings object
do they normalize audio data???? 
    ->tuxguitar calculates with raw byte values from the driver, 
    ranging from -128 to 127.
in tarsos dsp .... they use [-1, 1]
yin does not do autocorrelation.
BAM it works ;-))))
maybe remove tuning strings ... to make tuning automatic
UIWindow dialog....
    UIPanel group
        groupLayout
dialogLayout -> groupLayout -> specialLayout -> fine tuner -> string buttons
                1.1             1.1             1.1             1.2
                            -> tunLayout
                                2.1
                            -> rough tuner
                                3.1
somehow removing string buttons does not work ;-(
ok, so we leave buttons and remove functionality first
TGTuningString is not needed any more...
String Buttons and fireCurrentString disabled in TGTunerDialog
todo: cleaning up, make it really work
how does frequency get from tuner to FineWidget?
TGTunerDialog 
    ->fireFrequency
        ->fineTuner.setCurrentFrequency
TGTuner
    ->owns TGTunerDialog as mainWindow
        ->mainWindow.fireFrequency
